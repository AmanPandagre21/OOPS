# What is OOPS <br>
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.

# Advantages and Limitation of OOps ?<br>

# What are some other programming paradigms other than OOPs? <br>

Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach

# All access modifiers

  - Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
  - Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level,     it will be the default.
  - Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it           cannot be accessed from outside the package.
  - Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the           package.

# Class & Objects

Class => Class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. Class is the only logical representation of the data. For example, Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties, and the actions performed by the body parts are known as functions. The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated. <br>

Objects => Object is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item. An object can operate on both data members and member functions.  <br>
```java
Example 1:
class Student {
   String name;
   int age;
  
   public void getInfo() {
       System.out.println("The name of this Student is " + this.name);
       System.out.println("The age of this Student is " + this.age);
   }
}
 
public class OOPS {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
       Student s1 = new Student();
       s1.name = "Aman";
       s1.age = 24;
       s1.getInfo();
 
       Student s2 = new Student();
       s2.name = "Shradha";
       s2.age = 22;
       s2.getInfo();
   }
}
Example 2:
class Pen {
   String color;
  
   public void printColor() {
       System.out.println("The color of this Pen is " + this.color);
   }
}
 
public class OOPS {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
       Pen p1 = new Pen();
       p1.color = blue;
 
       Pen p2 = new Pen();
       p2.color = black;
 
       Pen p3 = new Pen();
       p3.color = red;
 
       p1.printColor();
       p2.printColor();
       p3.printColor();
   }
}
```

üöÄüöÄNOTE : When an object is created using a new keyword, then space is allocated for the variable in a heap, and the starting address is stored in the stack memory.<br>

## Constructor :
Constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally. <br>
 - Constructors have the same name as class or structure. 
 - Constructors don‚Äôt have a return type. (Not even void)
 - Constructors are only called once, at object creation.

There can be three types of constructors in Java. 

1. Non-Parameterized constructor : A constructor which has no argument is known as non-parameterized constructor(or no-argument constructor). It is invoked at the time of creating an object. If we don‚Äôt create one then it is created by default by Java.
```java
class Student {
   String name;
   int age;
  
   Student() {
       System.out.println("Constructor called");
   }
}
```
2. Parameterized constructor : Constructor which has parameters is called a parameterized constructor. It is used to provide different values to distinct objects. 
```java
class Student {
   String name;
   int age;
  
   Student(String name, int age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
   }
}
```
3. Copy Constructor : A Copy constructor is an overloaded constructor used to declare and initialize an object from another object. There is only a user defined copy constructor in Java(C++ has a default one too).
```java
class Student {
   String name;
   int age;
  
   Student(Student s2) {
       this.name = s2.name;
       this.age = s2.age;
   }
}
```


üöÄüöÄNote : Unlike languages like C++, Java has no Destructor. Instead, Java has an efficient  garbage collector that deallocates memory automatically.

## this 
‚Äòthis‚Äô keyword :  ‚Äòthis‚Äô keyword in Java that refers to the current instance of the class. In OOPS it is used to: pass the current object as a parameter to another method refer to the current class instance variable

 ## new
 The new keyword is a Java operator that creates the object. Initialization: The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object.
 
 ## super
 - The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.
 - It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
 - The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses and subclasses that have methods with the same name.
 
 ## static
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

1) Java static variable
 - If you declare any variable as static, it is known as a static variable.
 - The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects (which is not unique for each object), for example, the company name of employees,      college name of students, etc.
 - The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
 
 2) Java static method
 - If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.
 - A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
 - A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
 - A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

3) Java static block
 - Is used to initialize the static data member.
 - It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.

```java
lass Student {
   static String school;
   String name;   
}
 
public class OOPS {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
       Student.school = "JMV";
       Student s1 = new Student();
       Student s2 = new Student();
 
       s1.name = "Meena";
       s2.name = "Beena";
 
       System.out.println(s1.school);
       System.out.println(s2.school);
   }
}
```

 ## final
 - The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).
 - The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).
 - The final keyword is called a "modifier".
 


# Inheritance

Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such a way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other classes. 
In Java, the class which inherits the members of another class is called derived class and the class whose members are inherited is called base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.  <br>

Types of Inheritance : 

1. Single inheritance : When one class inherits another class, it is known as single level inheritance 
```java
class Shape {
   public void area() {
       System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void area(int h, int b) {
       System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
   }  
}
```

2. Hierarchical inheritance : Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class. 
```java
class Shape {
   public void area() {
       System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void area(int h, int b) {
       System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
   }  
}
class Circle extends Shape {
   public void area(int r) {
       System.out.println((3.14)*r*r);
   }  
}
```

3. Multilevel inheritance : Multilevel inheritance is a process of deriving a class from another derived class. 
```java
class Shape {
   public void area() {
       System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void area(int h, int b) {
       System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
   }  
}
class EquilateralTriangle extends Triangle {
   int side;
}
```

4. Hybrid inheritance : Hybrid inheritance is a combination of 
simple, multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance. 


# Package in Java
Package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. Packages can be built-in or user defined.
Built-in packages - java, util, io etc.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

import java.io.IOException;
```

# Polymorphism 

Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. Precisely, Poly means ‚Äòmany‚Äô and morphism means ‚Äòforms‚Äô. 

Types of Polymorphism IMP 
1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static) 
2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic) 
Let‚Äôs understand them one by one : 

## Compile Time Polymorphism : 
The polymorphism which is implemented at the compile time is known as compile-time polymorphism. Example - Method Overloading 

## Method Overloading : 
Method overloading is a technique which allows you to have more than one function with the same function name but with different functionality.

## Method overloading can be possible on the following basis: 
1. The type of the parameters passed to the function. 
2. The number of parameters passed to the function.

```java
class Student {
   String name;
   int age;
  
   public void displayInfo(String name) {
       System.out.println(name);
   }
 
   public void displayInfo(int age) {
       System.out.println(age);
   }
 
   public void displayInfo(String name, int age) {
       System.out.println(name);
       System.out.println(age);
   }
}
```

## Runtime Polymorphism : 
Runtime polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism. Function overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism. Function overriding means when the child class contains the method which is already present in the parent class. Hence, the child class overrides the method of the parent class. In case of function overriding, parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different definition. The call to the function is determined at runtime is known as runtime polymorphism.

```java
class Shape {
   public void area() {
       System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void area(int h, int b) {
       System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
   }  
}
class Circle extends Shape {
   public void area(int r) {
       System.out.println((3.14)*r*r);
   }  
}
```

# Encapsulation 
Encapsulation is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit called class. In Encapsulation, the data is not accessed directly; it is accessed through the functions present inside the class. In simpler words, attributes of the class are kept private and public getter and setter methods are provided to manipulate these attributes. Thus, encapsulation makes the concept of data hiding possible.(Data hiding: a language feature to restrict access to members of an object, reducing the negative effect due to dependencies. e.g. "protected", "private" feature in Java). 


# Abstraction 
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.

## Data binding :
Data binding is a process of binding the application UI and business logic. Any change made in the business logic will reflect directly to the application UI. 

Abstraction is achieved in 2 ways :
 - Abstract class
 - Interfaces (Pure Abstraction)

## Abstract Class
- An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
- It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
- It cannot be instantiated.
- It can have constructors and static methods also.
- It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

```java
abstract class Animal {
   abstract void walk();
   void breathe() {
       System.out.println("This animal breathes air");
   }
   Animal() {
       System.out.println("You are about to create an Animal.");
   }
}
 
class Horse extends Animal {
   Horse() {
       System.out.println("Wow, you have created a Horse!");
   }
   void walk() {
       System.out.println("Horse walks on 4 legs");
   }
}
 
class Chicken extends Animal {
   Chicken() {
       System.out.println("Wow, you have created a Chicken!");
   }
   void walk() {
       System.out.println("Chicken walks on 2 legs");
   }
}
 
public class OOPS {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Horse horse = new Horse();
      horse.walk();
      horse.breathe();
   }
}
```

## Interfaces
 - All the fields in interfaces are public, static and final by default.
 - All methods are public & abstract by default.
 - A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
 - Interfaces support the functionality of multiple inheritance.

```java
interface Animal {
   void walk();
}
 
class Horse implements Animal {
   public void walk() {
       System.out.println("Horse walks on 4 legs");
   }
}
 
class Chicken implements Animal {
   public void walk() {
       System.out.println("Chicken walks on 2 legs");
   }
}
 
public class OOPS {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Horse horse = new Horse();
      horse.walk();
   }
}
```

# Abstraction And Interfaces

 - Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. From Java 9, it can have private concrete methods as well.
 - Final Variables: Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
 - Type of variables: Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. The interface has only static and final variables.
 - Implementation: Abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface. Interface can‚Äôt provide the implementation of an abstract class.
 - Inheritance vs Abstraction: A Java interface can be implemented using the keyword ‚Äúimplements‚Äù and an abstract class can be extended using the keyword ‚Äúextends‚Äù.
 - Multiple implementations: An interface can extend one or more Java interfaces; an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
 - Multiple Inheritance:  Interface supports multiple inheritance; an abstraction does not support multiple inheritance.
 - Accessibility of Data Members: Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.
